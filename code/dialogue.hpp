"\n It is the 117th age, the subcontinent of Suvarnabhumi, in the planet of Purvis."
"The sky, once filled with stars, has become a bit quieter,"
"and the land has grown out with dry mountains as the tectonic plates converge again. "
"The gods take a less active participation in the world, "
"testing the way they have taught the sentient creatures of the world by seeing what they can accomplish without them. "
"\n\n"
"Petetra, a Vanarite or a little person with a monkey tail, "
"has just discovered the reason why the local village amid the marsh-flats has stopped getting its water. "
"The underground channel beneath his town, the ancient aqueduct built by the Asrahan precursors, "
"has been blocked by a great demon. Their townsfolk have already fled to greener pastures (literally),"
" leaving only him and the traveling merchant in town. It is up to them to go underground, "
"discover the secret of the Asrahan, and defeat the great demon Obwer. Petetra could return a hero, or never return at all."
"\n\n"
"To accomplish his task, Petetra needed the cannon-staff. "
"Swinging down by his tail into the great underground cavern that would lead him to it, and which also housed the demon Obwer,"
" Petetra took a moment to let his eyes adjust to the relative darkness. His ears picked up the pitter-patter of water dripping from the stalagtites up above."
" Faintly, he heard scittering. There was movement in the other cave-room. Petetra drew up his knife, "
"knowing that anything still alive, or I should say moving, in this cave would not be friendly."
" It would be a long trip.\n";

"\nAfter scrounging together all that he could find, he gave the merchant all his money to have a spring-divining stick."

" hometown could lead him to the cannon-staff.\n";

inline std::string staffAcquired = 
"\n Over sheer and through the tunnels, through paths and across underground rivers,"
" he followed the path on the wall named Kuruk, one stretched straight back to his hometown."
"Keeping the way to his town on his back at all times, Petetra’s body grew thinner and his feet grew hard, "
" finding little food in his subterranean environment except the occasional cave-fish and a snack he could get from the merchant."
"\n\n After what felt like forever, and at the very end of his wits,"
" Petetra found the Arkal spring, where the cannon-staff came from. "
" Climbing to the end, he found the spring where the cannon-staff was lodged into the ground. "
"Dislodging the staff, he took the gunpowder and the bullets for the staff held in the pagoda nearby, and took the book that described how they went."
"\n\nAll of this searching, just for a glorified gun. It had better work. \n";

inline std::string theSage = 
"\n  On his way back, which felt much faster than his travel to the cannon-staff, Petetra found a listening sage. In front of the sage, Petetra bowed and asked one question. "
"\n\n"
"“I have read books before about the true meaning of infinity. It is endless and beyond endless is endless. Yet, in spite of all that you have told me, I have traveled for a month and have spent my time returning all to read the nature of a gun. When I look upon this cannon-staff, I am filled only with sadness, for I know that this staff is only useful as a weapon against monsters. It cannot heal, it cannot feed someone, it cannot speak to me. It is useful for only one thing. How can I follow the path of righteousness if every time I wake up, I think only of the gun? How can I dream forever if this earthly endeavor weighs down on my soul, an endeavor I have only done because the Elders have told me to do so? If it weighs down on my body, thin as it becomes now?”"
"\n\n"
"The sage cleared his throat, and then said, “I think you misunderstood those books. You only wish to do good, and are therefore not like those who are hypocritical or use spirituality for their own benefit.”"
"\n\n"
"You are faced here with two options. Either you sacrifice more of your time and effort into slaying the monster, or you don’t, and you leave  to help your family in the capital city. Think now about your actions, my friend, not just about the way that you feel. A soul is more than what you have done through actions, more than the thoughts that you put in your mind. Your soul’s weight is filled through the consequences of your actions, and the result that it will have on others. You may feel better now for having not taken the life of such a glorious demon, but in the future you may be weighed down with the knowledge of what you have not done now. Instead of letting the rest of the world decide what to do with the demon, decide for yourself on what must be done, instead of what necessarily makes you feel good.”"
"\n\n"
"Petetra then asked, “but then what about my will? Am I really exercising my free will if I have been told what to do by my village’s elders? As a being of flesh and blood, what even is my will if my thoughts and actions are all, at their basest form, the result of calculations in my brain, the various circumstances which have shaped my life? And does this mean that the outcome of this coming battle is already determined by the universe’s toppling dominoes?”"
"\n\n"
"The sage laughed. As he disappeared, a voice echoed out to Petetra. “I can’t really answer that question. All I can tell you is that what will happen, will happen. And yet at the same time, it is really all up to you. Be you believing in the soul or in the brain, they are still you.”"
"\n\n"
"Petetra stroked the fur on his chin for a second. That’s a pretty funny contradiction, he thought to himself, as he stood on the passage led to Obwer’s chamber and the blocked aqueduct.";

inline std::string meetingObwer = 
" Though the light above reflected across some stones, the room where Obwer was seemed strangely dark, and not in a way that Petetra felt comfortable looking into. Likewise, the air seemed cold and humid. Emerging from that shadow, Obwer, crowned with dark flowers that looked like huge pimples and pores, roared out and pointed his greatsword at Petetra. His flesh seemed like a combination of splintered bark and mold on bread, pulsating in a way that was only accentuated by the mournful grimace on Obwer’s face."
"\n\n"
"Petetra was still a little bit confused, and wanted to think a bit longer, prepare a bit longer. But  there was no time for that now. He was ready for the fight.";
